### About Me

I'm an 8th-grade enthusiast from Shanghai passionate in mathematics, physics, and computer science.

For me, mathematics provides the language for everything, while physics gives you the moment where you suddenly feel intuitive, and computer science gives you the opportunity for application, because it provides you with the tools to build something real.

When I finally knew how to combine these three things and use them effectively, that is the moment I started to feel a tiny bit of satisfaction. 

I also have a bit of foundation in mathematics, mainly in calculus and linear algebra.

Finally, this GitHub account is new (i.e., recently created) as you can see from the contribution activities. I look forward to interact with more people.

### My Journey So Far

My journey into programming started a few years ago when I wrote my first lines of code in Python.

Then, over time, characters turn into lines, lines turn into chunks of code, and these chunks turn into actual projects. 

Same with mathematics. Since I need more math to do more stuff, I decided to study more math, and, coincidentally, I also love math, so here we go. Meanwhile, I also got to study some physics because I also need them for projects.

### What I'm Working On

Right now I'm working on nonlinear differential equations on the mathematics side because the real world is almost never linear and you will almost never solve any real-world problems if you only pay attention to linear systems. Nonlinear dynamics, undeniably, is a bit challenging, but I will try anyway since I find it interesting.

For the computer science side, I am deciding not to study to much theory, and instead work on projects before I actually possess the ability to systematically learn it. AI and machine learning is my primary field of focus because it is the field that is developing at an incredibly fast velocity, accumulating a significant amount of magnitude over a short period of time. 

There are a lot of other things I want to explore, but I am planning to do it one step at a time.

### Languages I've Explored

<p>

</p>

By the way, these languages are solely those which I've had hands-on experience of at least a few coding hours with, so they are not necessarily ones I've mastered. Among them, Python is probably my strongest language probably because I had the most experience with it, and it's also what I often use for AI and data-related work. JavaScript and TypeScript are very useful for web-based projects, so I would say I also have some experience on them. The others are the ones I've dabbled in to varying degrees. 

I'm saying this for a reason. Programming languages are tools and different tools are, of course, best suited for different jobs. To handle a variety of jobs, you need to be exposed to multiple languages, and it will be impossible to master every single one of them within a relatively short period. Instead, I focus on understanding the core concepts. 

### My Approach to Learning

I believe in learning by doing. You can read all you want, but the real understanding comes when you actually try to build something. Whenever I pick up a new concept, I try to use it in a project as quickly as possible. Making mistakes and debugging them is basically how I learn.

I also try to go deep instead of staying on the surface. It's easy to learn a little about a lot of things, but I've realized that real understanding comes from digging into the details. When I was learning machine learning, I didn't just want to know how to use libraries. I wanted to know what was actually happening, so I went back to the math.

That said, I also try to stay open to ideas from different places. Sometimes a concept from physics helps me understand something in computer science, or a math technique gives me a new way to think about an AI problem. I'm still figuring out how to balance going deep with staying curious about everything else.

### Fun Fact

I'm a serious guy. When I work on something, I put my full attention into it. I don't really like doing things halfway, and I always try to commit things fully. Some people might say that's intense, but I think that's just how I am.

By the way, being serious is not equivalent to not being fun.

### Looking Ahead

I'm still young and there's a lot I don't know. But honestly, that's kind of the exciting part. Every day there's something new to learn, something to figure out, some project to work on.
